# Optimizing Alpha: Rebalancing Strategies for Equal-Weighted Small-Cap Portfolios

This repository contains the final project for the **FRE-6123 Financial Risk Management** course. The project investigates how rebalancing frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly) impact the alpha and cumulative returns of equal-weighted (EW) portfolios in the small-cap universe. Using factor models and regression analysis, this study identifies optimal strategies for maximizing alpha.

## Project Overview

### Objectives
1. Analyze the effects of rebalancing frequencies on small-cap EW portfolios, focusing on alpha generation and cumulative returns.
2. Explore factor contributions (e.g., Size, Short-Term Reversal, Momentum) to portfolio performance under various rebalancing strategies.
3. Provide actionable insights into optimal rebalancing frequencies for portfolio managers.

### Key Findings
- **Weekly Rebalancing** strikes the best balance, capturing the size premium while mitigating volatility.
- **Daily Rebalancing** offers higher short-term returns but exposes portfolios to greater volatility and transaction costs.
- **Monthly and Quarterly Rebalancing** fail to fully capture the benefits of short-term factors like Size and STR, resulting in lower alpha.
